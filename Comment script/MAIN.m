% Summary: This is the MAIN script that is responsible to call all the supporting functions and scripts to run.

% Objective: Preliminary design of a small satellite launch vehicle configuration for a 50kg payload to LEO (400 km).
%            The launcher 1st stage must be solid rocket motor and should be recoverable.

% Algorithm: The design algorithm is based on initial input values for propulsion, based on the CEA code. 
%            Optimal stating algorithm is implemented using Lagrangian Multipliers to evaluate the best 
%            possible mass distribution and staging configuration. The script then completes the sizing 
%            of the stages and propulsion systems based on empirical data of the fineness ratios. Then, mass
%            estimation is carried out using empircal formulas and data curve fitting. The script continues to 
%            iterate over the sizing and optimal staging to satisfy the fitting data within a tolerance. On 
%            reaching convergence, the configuration is finalised. The script then performs frequency analysis 
%            on the launcher design. Further, the script performs trajectory determination and optimisation based
%            on the data output of the DATCOM script. The script also evaluates the revovery predictions for the 
%            1st stageFinally, the script tries to implement control algorithm to ensure and simulate optimal
%            trajectory compliance.
