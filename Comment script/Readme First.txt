Due to the specific request to include specific script fies, GaliLEO group has not incuded:

- Script files pertaining to the management part of the project. 
- The codes for conducting Pareto analysis.
- CEA Data and output.
- Empirical Data sources and references.
- Technical Drawing and CAD models.


To run the codes on MATLAB, please run the file named "MAIN"


The folders structure is as follows:

"MA" - Mission analysis
"PROP" - Propulsion
"STR" - Structures

"config.m" - contains the data input to the "MAIN" script e.g: constants, constraints, e.t.codes

The ".mat" extension files in the folder are the matlab data files storing the variables and its values.

Thank you for your patience!
